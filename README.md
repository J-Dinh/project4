## By: Jas Dinh, Huy Nguyen, Yaning Zhu

In PSY341K, we learned classification and clustering, dimension reduction, ensemble approach, time series analysis, association rule learning, and neural networks.
This research report is the capstone project for PSY341K and applies a machine learning solution to a real-world problem.
We investigated the factors influencing whether a package arrives on time in the ecommerce industry.
