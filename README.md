In PSY341K, we learned classification and clustering, dimension reduction, ensemble approach, time series analysis, association rule learning, and neural networks.
This research report is the capstone project for PSY341K and applies a machine learning solution to a real-world problem.
We investigated the factors influencing whether a package arrives on time in the ecommerce industry.
